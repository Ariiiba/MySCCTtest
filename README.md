Alpha SC2 Teamleague: http://alpha.tl/

AlphaSC2-Tool is a Python 3.6 script that can load all relevant data from an Alpha SC2 Teamleague match and convert it such that the information can be readily included for streaming, e.g., in OBS-Studio. Moreover, the tool generates corresponding map icons for presentation on your stream, including the map, the players, their races and the score (if played).
