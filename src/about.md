StarCraft Casting Tool (SCC Tool) is a Python 3 script that can grab all relevant data of a Stracraft 2 Team League Match from either [Alpha SC2 Teamleague](http://alpha.tl/) (AlphaTL) or [Russian StarCraft Team League](http://hdgame.net/en/tournaments/list/tournament/rstl-12/) (RSTL) and process it such that the information can be readily included for streaming, e.g., in OBS-Studio, X-Split or any other similar streaming tool. Alternatively, the format of a *Custom Match* can be specified. The title of your Twitch stream and your Nightbot chat commands can be updated accordingly by a single click.
